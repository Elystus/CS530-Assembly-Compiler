# CS 530 Systems Programming
## SIC/XE Compiler (C++)

This group project spanned the entire Spring semester of 2016 and covered many topics. A significant amount of the programming was done by myself as I was able to devote the most time to this project. A large majority of the error testing was conducted by Shayan, who also helped structure the program. The program is not as clean and well structured as I would have liked, but we were under heavy time constraint. Enjoy! 

The aim of this project was to create a SIC/XE assembly language compiler for C++. However, it did not have to generate complete Object code (This was optional extra credit). Our program outputs the base Object code, but it is not wholely complete. Break down of the work done by each individual is below. Each member made a significant contribution unless otherwise noted (aka. The parathesis).
